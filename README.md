# Hackathon_Dribble
A repo for competing in the US Soccer Hackathon.

## What is the problem we are trying to solve?

Woman's Soccer has incredible potential to grow globally.  The 2015 Women's World Cup final was watched by a staggering 750 million people! In the past year, an off World Cup year, Mexico in their first year in league play had multiple games with over 50 thousand fans in attendace. England's Super league did the same in their semis and finals. Once fans leave the match or turn off their TV there are very few web and mobile apps that are continuously engaging with those fans, particularly ones with a global outlook.

## Challenges

There are no women's soccer API's out there and very few quality datasets freely available. Other sports such as women's basketball have this.

## What is our project?

This project drives consumer-centric engagement in women's soccer. We believe the best way to grow the game is to create habit forming hooks. Making predictions in is a fun and safe way of engaging. No money Our business model is providing a alternative store that sells items not under the US Soccer Umbrella.

Our app is divided into 5 sections:

Dribble - An area where a user interacts with predictions and statistics

Store - Where the user purchases items or player experiences

Wall - An area where a fan sees realtime tweets and sentiments overs time (we also recorded tonight's Chicago Red Stars vs Seattle Reign game and provided insights over the entire game!)

Twitter - Tweets of WoSo Writers, Teams Members, Retired Players, Recent Callups by category
